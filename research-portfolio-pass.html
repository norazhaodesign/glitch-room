    <p> What is documented in the research portfolio?</p>
    Relevant supporting developmental materials of the project Glitch Rooms.<br>
    <p>Why is it presented as a webpage? </p>
    1 To be cohesive with other parts of the project. <br>
    2 To enable live demonstration of past experiments inside this document, as they are only executable within a browser. <br>
    <p>Why is it mainly constructed by questions and answers?</p>
    1 For myself to be reflective by answering the questions. <br>
    2 To make it more engaging for the reader by raising curiosity with questions. <br>
    3 To make the contents easy to navigate through. <br>

    <p class="left-title">Pattern as subject</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>Why was pattern chosen as my research subject?</p>
    To fulfil my wish of exploring more visual-oriented areas rather than social-related topics. <br>
    <p>What experiments did I do?</p>
    1 The Letter Evolution: an experiment which aims at exploring the usage and effect of pattern making techniques on typographic design. <br>

    <p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of these experiments? </p>
    1 Strength: explorations of pattern from different aspects. <br>
    2 Weakness: limited depth of investigation on pattern, and lack of iterations due to frequent change of directions. <br>
    <p>How to improve it? </p>
    To zoom down area of intended investigation and find a focus. <br>

  <div>
    <p>What was chosen as the focus?</p>
    Mass-produced unique patterns. <br>
    <p>What informed it?</p>
    Creative Review Annual 2019: each copy comes with a unique cover design created by Alex Trochut [<a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/one-of-a-kind-how-our-unique-annual-covers-were-created/">more info</a>

    <h6>&#8679; Selected covers of Creative Review Annual 2019. Design by Alex Trochut (2019).</h6>
    The appeal of this project is that it doesn’t aim at making one specific design. Instead, by making use of a generative tool, the designer was able to create unique design pieces. The results, as well as the approach, is stimulating. <br>
    <p> What was used as the generator of these variations? </p>
    HP Mosaic: a software which takes vector-based seed files as input and generates a set number of different output by random scaling, trans-positioning and rotating. <br>

    <p>What are the limitations of this software?</p>
    1 The options offered are limited. <br>
    2 The results, directly extracted from the already made designs, are more or less expected. <br>

    <p class="left-title">Coding as tool</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p>What tool should be adopted for my project?</p>
    Coding: through writing code manually, I may build an executable program in which underlying computing tasks are constructed from my specific design needs.<br>
    <p>Why?</p>
    1 To break the restrictions set by ready-made design software. <br>
    2 To work directly with the medium which constructs digital design output. <br>
    3 Most importantly, to learn to code through practice and develop it as a skill to improve my competitiveness in the future. <br>

    <p> What experiment did I do? </p>
    Mouse XY: an experiment in which the construction of pattern is made viable through mouse movement. Double click to reset current canvas. Right click to save the image. <br>
    A JavaScript library called p5.js is used in this experiment [<a href="https://p5js.org/">more info</a>

<p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of this experiment?</p>
1 Strength: it’s responsive and playful. <br>
2 Weakness: it’s highly reliant on manual input. Therefore, output quality may vary depending on the skill of the ‘painter’ and effort put in ‘painting’ the picture. <br>
    <p> How to solve it? </p>
To build a program which functions automatically (generative). <br>
<p>What demonstrated its viability?</p>   
Distinction Machine: a project by Kim Albrecht which explores computational behaviour under ambiguous situations. Geometries of different colours are positioned at the same location to produce pattern [<a href="https://distinctionmachine.kimalbrecht.com/">more info</a>].<br>

<p>What technique was used to generate its dynamic output?</p>   <br>

Z-fighting: a phenomenon in 3D rendering which occurs when two or more layers are positioned in identical or proximate positions. The colours ‘fight’ with each other to be shown on screen pixels and result in a flickering rasterisation effect. <br>
<p>What coding tool was used to construct these scenes?</p>
Three.js: a JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in web browsers [<a href="https://threejs.org/">more info</a>]. <br>  </div>

    <p> What did I do next? </p>
    An investigation of z-fighting behaviour. <br>
    <p> What method was used? </p>
    Controlled experiments: scientific tests in which everything is held constant except for one variable. <br>
    <p>What are the findings?</p>
    Changes on position of the camera, and rotation angle of the plane on x and y axes may result in different looks of generated images. <br>

    <p> How to make the findings accessible? </p>
    To add controls of these variables to enable generation of various result sets. <br>
    <p>What else did I do? </p>
    1 Colour adjustments option: to allow setting up colours of personal preferences; <br>
    2 Random appearances: to create varied results upon each visit (or refreshment of the page) by combining randomly generated colour, plane rotation and camera position values; <br>
    3 Screenshot function: to offer a way of preserving generated results. <br>
