    <p>2.3 Personalisation Through Variables</p>
    <br>
    One of the leading exponents of Conceptual art, Sol LeWitt stressed the idea behind his work over its execution.  Some of LeWitt’s most integral pieces are his Wall Drawings, in which he explored myriad variations of applying drawn lines onto walls (Artnet, 2019). As an example, his Wall Drawing #260 (1975) (Fig 9) devised a new system of drawing. The liner system, determined in advance by LeWitt, is carried out by others, be they artists, trained assistants, or novice volunteers, based upon his instructions (MoMA, 2008). <br>
    <br>
    In the 1967 essay Paragraphs on Conceptual Art, LeWitt wrote “In conceptual art, the idea or concept is the most important aspect of the work. When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all of the planning and decisions are made beforehand, and the execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” In short, for conceptual art, it is usually free from the dependence on the skill of the artist as a craftsman, and the idea becomes art itself. <br>
    <br>
    That being said, for an audience, perhaps the fascination of conceptual art is that, although the process is mechanical, the result varies. LeWitt compared his role to a composer who creates a score that may be played by musicians. “The concept or score remains constant, but the wall drawing, like a musical performance, will vary slightly each time it is realised anew (MoMA, 2008)”. The system and variables, together, contribute and shape the outcome which is somewhat relevant to its time, location, and many other factors. And because of this relevancy, in a sense, it can be considered that personalisation is integrated into the work. <br>

    <br>
    As we move into the scope of digital art, LeWitt’s approach could not be simply duplicated due to the change in medium. The unambiguity of computational language, artefacts generated from a set of instructions maintains fairly accurate and consistent. Any drawing by hand, even with the intention of replication, is different from another. The variables are welded on the act of execution, whereas a digital artefact can be recreated countless times, winding up exact identical. <br>
    <br>
    Is it unfeasible to migrate this methodology to the digital medium? Certainly, we can introduce variables in the system by setting up an algorithm which produces different values upon running the program. But this approach can feel a bit rigid, and may even be considered as a disguised replacement of concept. Notwithstanding, in seek of a parallel solution, it may be helpful if we personify a digital device and impersonate computational tasks, which, in other words, is to think like a computer. <br>
    <br>
    Similar to people, devices also behave and perform differently more or less. The instance where the differences are shown most significantly is when faults and failures occur, which, in some cases, leads to distortion in the visual output. If the deformity is utilized with an appropriate approach, it may be transformed into a tool which generates varied results. In fact, this concept has already been explored by numerous artists and designers whose practice typically sits within the area of glitch art.<br>
    <br>
    <p>2.4 Glitch Art as Context</p>
    <br>
    By definition, a glitch is an error. Glitch art uses these digital or analogue errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices. It re-casts a new light on digital faults and interruptions and turning them into powerful elements of expression. <br>
    <br>
    <p>2.4.1 What is glitch art?</p>
    <br>
    From a scientific standpoint, a glitch is an unexpected spike in electrical current (Wakerly, 2006, cited in Austin, 2017) or the phenomena of an algorithm behaving in a way that is unexpected to either the programmer or the viewer (Moradi, 2009). At first glance, this appears to be a pragmatic and useable definition. For example, if a simple logic-gate circuit or algorithm returns the incorrect response, clearly something that objectively resembles a glitch has occurred (Austin, 2017). <br>
    <br>
    However, there are two serious flaws under this approach. Firstly, electrical systems are rarely simple enough to check if a glitch has objectively occurred without specialist knowledge and skills. Secondly, the word ‘unexpected’ implies a relativist subjectivity to the term. In other words, it is possible for a viewer to proclaim that a glitch has occurred within a system which the engineer or programmer has set up to work in precisely that way. The glitch thus embodies a more complex techno-social relationship than merely an objective state of error and is indefinable within only an objective-scientific framework (Austin, 2017). <br>
    <br>
    To understand a glitch, we may start by looking at the historical context. Glitch has been around and in use by artists since the late 1970s and first started to become prominent more or less simultaneously across the world during the 1990s as a result of the faults and failures of digital technology. There are two main factors which contribute to the result of partial and damaged files: the vagaries and interruptions common to dial-up internet access, and the slow speeds of download (Betancourt, 2017). Building on the experience and aesthetics of computer malfunction, glitch artists manipulate electronic devices to explores how they can be gateways into understanding the cultural values that are associated with technology (Brown, 2012). <br>

    <br>
    <p>2.4.2 Why it matters?</p>
    <br>
    In the way that punk music was a reaction against the hyper polished commercial rock and roll of the time, glitch art was also a reaction against the hyper-realism portrayed in contemporary media. The process of glitch making empowers people to understand a digital device’s underlying structure and mechanism (Brown, 2012). <br>
    <br>
    Besides, the glitch aesthetic has also been established, spread and accepted over the years. In 2009 Rosa Menkman wrote and performed a ‘Glitch Studies Manifesto’ in which she argues that ‘what was once understood as a glitch has now become a new commodity.’ By the 2010s, the glitch aesthetic had been widely appropriated in pop culture in nearly every conceivable form: movies, music videos, advertisements, and video games. As of now, glitch art is still niche, but glitch aesthetic has become ubiquitous (Pieschel, 2014). <br>
    <br>
    Moreover, the value of glitch also stands as it opens up new methodologies for visual creation (Austin, 2017). The glitch offers a disruption to the design process which, may shift the outcome haphazardly to directions which do not converge to the designer’s intention. <br>
    <br>
    <p>2.5 Z-fighting as Methodology</p>
    <br>
    There are many methods and techniques which can be utilised to produce glitches. For instance, databending is the process of manipulating a media file of a certain format with software which is designed to edit files of another format (Ahuja and Lu, 2014). As a typical result, distortion in the medium occurs. Although this method provides a great variety of intriguing output, each result often requires manual configuration. <br>
    <br>
    Fortunately, there are also malfunctions, such as z-fighting, which offer gateways of producing automatic and constant glitching output. <br>

    <br>
    <p>2.5.1 What is z-fighting, and what is the cause of it?</p>
    <br>
    Z-fighting is a phenomenon in 3D rendering that occurs when two or more layers are positioned in identical or proximate positions. The layers 'fighting' with each other to be shown on the screen pixels and causes an overall flickering, noisy rasterisation effect (Fig 12) (VisCircle, 2019a). <br>
    <br>
    The cause of z-fighting is an algorithm called z-buffering, which is used in 3D graphics to mimic the physicality of the real world. Just as the person in front of a TV is what the viewer sees, not the screen. By having an object in the foreground blocking the view behind it, the pixel closer to the viewer is the one being displayed (VisCircle, 2019b). <br>
